# Hand Written Digit Recognition
We have a training data of 10,000 digits and used 3 classifiers KNN, ANN And SVM to recognize a hand written Digit. Implemented it using different feature Technique like HOG, BWP, HWT etc. The accuracy is 97%.

# Feature Extraction Techniques
We used four Techniques for Feature Extraction on MNIST Dataset these are
	i) HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
	ii) LBP (Local Binary Patterns)
	iii) Black and White Pixels
	iv) Haar Wavelet Transformation
	We different Techniques for feature extraction. The statistical features of the histogram mean and
standard deviation, will be extracted from the images also we used LBP, BW Pixels and HWT
techniques for feature extraction.

# Methods/Classification Techniques
We used two Techniques for Classification given below
	
	i) Support Vector Machine
	ii) Decision Tree
	iii) KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
Also other detail are in Report that attached with it...
