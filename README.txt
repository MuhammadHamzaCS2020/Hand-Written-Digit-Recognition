# Feature Extraction Techniques
We used four Techniques for Feature Extraction on MNIST Dataset these are
	i) HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
	ii) LBP (Local Binary Patterns)
	iii) Black and White Pixels
	iv) Haar Wavelet Transformation
	We different Techniques for feature extraction. The statistical features of the histogram mean and
standard deviation, will be extracted from the images also we used LBP, BW Pixels and HWT
techniques for feature extraction.

# Methods/Classification Techniques
We used two Techniques for Classification given below
	i) Support Vector Machine
	ii) Decision Tree
